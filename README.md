# 2pake
2pake, or ppmake, or prepremake, is a lua script written to help with the generation of premake5 scripts for C/C++. It completely removes the need to edit lua code, and all that's required is a keyboard and the ability to read. Check out [example](https://github.com/Sk1-z/2pake/tree/main/example) to see the project structure generated.

# Usage
Download the binary file from the [repository's releases page](https://github.com/Sk1-z/2pake/releases) and place it where you would like the project to start. It's as simple as running `lua 2pake` and following the prompts.
